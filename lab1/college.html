            <P>
                We, at NIET, believe that the whole process of teaching can be highly enhanced by using the latest
                technological tools which further helps the students gain a better understanding of tough concepts and
                gives
                a boost by providing the ways and means to visualize the concept being put forward by the professors, or
                letâ€™s say, the education experts. Hence, the classrooms are well-equipped with projectors, computers,
                high-tech sound systems, OHPs and other kinds of audio-visual tools. The classrooms have ergonomically
                designed furniture, seamless Wi-Fi connectivity, climate controlling systems, aesthetic lighting, and
                visually pleasing interiors that make the environment of the classroom more conducive towards learning.

            The libraries at NIET occupy over 14,000 square feet area and provide students access to a vast repository
            of resources, including books and periodicals. The peaceful and sunlit areas provide ideal study spaces. Our
            libraries remain open until midnight on all days. During the examinations, they remain open for 24 hours.
            Completely automated library management systems make it possible to borrow books at any time of the day or
            night, as well as make reservations online. Multiple copies ensure that resources are easily available for
            reference in the library. Trained staff are always at hand to assist students
